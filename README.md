# Dealfront Review: Identify Website Visitors, Build Real Pipeline, Close More Deals

So here's the thing about B2B website traffic that most people kind of ignore — a huge chunk of the companies browsing your site are never going to fill out a contact form. They'll read your pricing page, poke around your case studies, maybe even come back a few times. And then? They just… disappear. You never know they existed.

That's exactly the problem Dealfront was built to solve. And after digging into how it actually works, what real users are saying, and how the pricing stacks up, here's the full picture.

## What Is Dealfront, Actually?

Dealfront is a go-to-market platform born out of the 2022 merger between two well-known names in the B2B space: **Echobot** (a German sales intelligence platform founded in 2011) and **Leadfeeder** (a Finnish website visitor identification tool founded in 2012). The merger was backed by a €180M investment from Great Hill Partners, and the company officially launched as Dealfront in April 2023.

Since then, they've kept building. In 2024, they pulled in an additional €30M from AshGrove Capital to fuel European expansion. Today, Dealfront has 250+ employees across 30+ countries, serves over 30,000 customer companies, and hosts a database covering 60+ million companies and 400+ million contacts.

The platform is headquartered in Karlsruhe, Germany, with a major office in Helsinki — and it's very much built with European markets in mind. GDPR compliance isn't an afterthought here; it's baked into the foundation. They host servers in Europe, source data from public registers, and actually show you *where* each data point came from. That kind of transparency is genuinely rare in this space.

## How It Works (The Short Version)

You install a lightweight tracking code on your website. Dealfront's system then uses IP matching, machine learning, and its own expansive databases to figure out which *companies* those anonymous visitors work for — even if those employees are working remotely from home.

Once a company is identified, Dealfront enriches it with firmographic data (industry, size, location, revenue), pulls up relevant contacts like decision-makers, and surfaces behavioral signals like which pages were visited, how long they stayed, and whether they hit high-intent pages like pricing or demo requests.

The result? Anonymous website traffic becomes a list of real, actionable company leads — automatically pushed into your CRM.

## The Platform Modules — What You're Actually Getting

Dealfront isn't one monolithic tool. It's built as a set of focused modules that work together (or standalone, depending on what you need):

**Leadfeeder (Web Visitors)** — This is the flagship. It identifies companies visiting your website in real time, scores them by intent, and syncs them straight to your CRM. It's the module with the most transparent, self-serve pricing.

**Target** — A B2B prospecting tool for building lists of companies that match your Ideal Customer Profile. Uses 100+ filters across firmographics, tech stacks, and behavior signals. Great for outbound teams that need a pipeline of new-name prospects.

**Connect** — Deep-dive company and contact profiles. Includes a Chrome browser extension so sales reps can research accounts on the fly without leaving their workflow.

**Datacare** — Keeps your existing CRM data clean, enriched, and accurate. If your CRM has been accumulating stale records for years, this is the module that fixes that.

**Promote** — IP-based B2B display advertising. Lets you retarget specific companies with ads, which works especially well when combined with Leadfeeder's visitor data.

**Dealfront AI** (launched May 2025) — A newer addition that adds AI Company Insights (ask natural language questions about any prospect), AI Contacts (surfaces key decision-maker info automatically), and AI Activity Summaries (plain-language breakdowns of visitor behavior).

## Dealfront Pricing — Here's Where It Gets Specific

Dealfront's pricing is split into two tracks: **Web Visitors Identification** (Leadfeeder), which has published, transparent pricing, and **Sales Intelligence** (Target, Connect, Datacare, Promote), which requires a custom quote based on team size, usage, and goals.

### Web Visitors (Leadfeeder) Pricing

The pricing model is usage-based — you pay according to how many *unique companies* Dealfront identifies on your site each month. If the same company visits multiple times, it only counts once. ISPs and low-quality traffic are automatically filtered out.

There's a **Free plan** that never expires — you get up to 100 identified companies per month, but only the last 7 days of visitor data, and several features are locked.

The **Paid plan** starts at **$99/month (billed annually)** and scales up from there. Annual billing saves you roughly 30% compared to monthly. Here's the full tier breakdown:

| Companies Identified/Month | Annual Billing (per month) | Monthly Billing (per month) |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 50 | $99 | ~$165 |
| 51 – 100 | $119 | ~$199 |
| 101 – 200 | $143 | ~$239 |
| 201 – 400 | $215 | ~$359 |
| 401 – 700 | $299 | ~$499 |
| 701 – 1,000 | $329 | ~$549 |
| 1,001 – 2,000 | $389 | ~$649 |
| 2,001 – 3,000 | $419 | ~$699 |
| 3,001 – 5,000 | $509 | ~$849 |
| 5,001 – 10,000 | $719 | ~$1,199 |
| 10,001 – 20,000 | $899 | ~$1,499 |
| 20,001 – 40,000 | $1,199 | ~$1,999 |

*Monthly billing estimates are approximate (~30% higher than annual). Annual plans are charged upfront for 12 months. Currency depends on your company location (USD or EUR).*

Every paid tier includes **unlimited users**, **unlimited visit data storage**, two-way CRM integrations, custom feeds and filters, automatic notifications via email or Slack, target account monitoring, website form tracking, and video/download engagement tracking.

### Sales Intelligence Pricing

For the Target, Connect, Datacare, and Promote modules, Dealfront doesn't publish fixed prices. You'll need to reach out to their sales team for a custom quote. The cost factors in team size, usage volume, and which features you need. According to third-party data, businesses typically spend between $788 and $3,779 on Dealfront overall, with an average around $1,912 annually.

## The 14-Day Free Trial — Worth Doing

This is genuinely one of the better trial setups out there. You get full access to everything for two weeks, which is enough time to actually see real visitor data come in and decide if it's useful for your business.

## What Real Users Are Saying

The reviews are a mixed but mostly positive picture. On G2, Dealfront averages around **4.5 out of 5** across a large number of reviews. TrustRadius users rate it **8.8 out of 10**.

Here's what keeps coming up in the positive feedback:

Users consistently praise the platform's ease of use. One G2 reviewer put it simply: the tools help identify leads efficiently, letting teams focus more on closing deals rather than hunting for them. The filtering capabilities — by industry, location, behavior, and intent — are a recurring highlight. Several users mention that enriching their CRM with Dealfront data transformed how they approach outreach.

One customer noted that processing time per lead dropped from 50 minutes down to 30 seconds after implementing the platform. Another reported a 34% increase in qualified sales leads. A company called Custobar shared results showing €180K in pipeline generated from website intent data alone. AutomatiKing reported doubling qualified outreach and driving 100% more signups while cutting manual research time by 70%.

On the less enthusiastic side, some users flagged occasional inaccuracies in company identification — particularly when visitors are using VPNs or corporate proxies. A few reviewers mentioned the pricing can feel steep for smaller teams, and there have been complaints about the account cancellation process. The free plan, while genuinely free forever, is limited enough that it's really more of a taste-test than a usable standalone product.

## Who Should Actually Use This?

Dealfront hits the sweet spot for **B2B companies with steady website traffic who sell into European markets**. If you've got visitors coming to your site and you're not capturing who those companies are, this is a legitimate solution.

It's especially strong for teams that already use CRM tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Pipedrive — the integrations are native and two-way, meaning data flows without manual work.

If you're a small startup with very low traffic (say, under 50 unique company visitors per month), the entry-level paid tier at $99/month will cover you, but you might want to start on the free plan first to see what kind of volume you're actually getting.

For larger enterprise teams with high traffic volumes and multiple sales reps, the higher tiers deliver real value — especially when combined with the Sales Intelligence modules for outbound prospecting and the AI features for faster qualification.
